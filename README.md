# Configuration Management

## Overview

Configuration Management is a FastAPI application designed to manage and retrieve configuration files efficiently. It utilizes Pydantic for data validation and settings management, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for handling application configurations.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Easily access configuration data through well-defined endpoints.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Securely manage sensitive information using environment variables.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging to track application behavior and issues.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Use Pydantic models to define and validate configurations dynamically.

## Getting Started

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:

   ```plaintext
   STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   API_KEY=your_api_key

### Customization Tips

- **Replace placeholders**: Update any placeholders (like `YourUsername`, `YourRepoName`) with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
- **Add project-specific sections**: If there are specific features, installation instructions, or configuration details unique to your project, include those in the README.
- **Additional documentation**: Consider adding a section for FAQ, troubleshooting, or examples of how to use the API if needed.
